# This program calculates the mass of a gas in a container based on the Ideal Gas Law.
# It allows the user to choose one of five gases (CH4, O2, H2, CO2, N2), and input the container's volume (in liters),
# the temperature (in Celsius), and the pressure (in atm). Using the Ideal Gas Law, the program computes the
# number of moles of the gas and its mass. Additionally, it generates a graph to show how the gas mass changes
# with pressure for the given conditions.

# Constants

    "H2": 2.016,   # Molecular weight of hydrogen in g/mol
    "CO2": 44.01,  # Molecular weight of carbon dioxide in g/mol
    "N2": 28.02    # Molecular weight of nitrogen in g/mol

# Step 2: Input the values for volume, temperature, and pressure
volume_L = float(input("Enter the volume of the container in L: "))  # in L
temperature_C = float(input("Enter the temperature of the gas in Â°C: "))  # in Celsius
pressure_atm = float(input("Enter the pressure of the gas in atm: "))  # in atm

# Step 3: Convert the units to standard SI units
temperature_K = temperature_C + 273.15  # Convert Celsius to Kelvin

# Step 4: Use the Ideal Gas Law to calculate the number of moles
# PV = nRT -> n = PV / RT
n_moles = (pressure_atm * volume_L) / (R * temperature_K)

# Step 5: Calculate the mass of the chosen gas
gas_mass = n_moles * MW

# Print the result
print(f"The mass of {gas_choice} in the container is {gas_mass:.2f} g.")

# Step 6: Create a graph showing the dependence of gas mass on pressure
pressures_atm = np.linspace(0.5, 300, 100)  # Generate a range of pressures in atm
masses = (pressures_atm * volume_L) / (R * temperature_K) * MW  # Calculate masses
