My GitHub profile is dedicated to creating simple Python scripts tailored for solving common chemical problems in the lab. These codes are designed to assist students in their studies, helping them pass exams or support their PhD research. The goal is to provide easy-to-use links so they can quickly access and apply these solutions in their work.
